/**
 * Test configuration for S3-compatible storage container lifecycle management.
 *
 * <p>This configuration provides a LocalStack S3 container for integration testing, simulating
 * S3-compatible cloud storage (like Backblaze B2) without requiring actual cloud resources. It is
 * designed to be used as part of the {@link FacadeIT} base test class infrastructure, which
 * orchestrates multiple test containers for comprehensive integration testing.
 *
 * <p><b>Container configuration:</b>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Image: localstack/localstack:2.3.0
 *   <li>Service: S3 only (lightweight configuration)
 *   <li>Test bucket: "test-bucket" (auto-created on startup)
 *   <li>Path-style access: Enabled for compatibility
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Integration with FacadeIT:</b> <br>
 * This class is not used directly in test classes. Instead, extend {@link FacadeIT} which handles
 * the lifecycle of this and other containers:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class MyIntegrationTest extends FacadeIT {
 *   @Test
 *   void testFileUpload() {
 *     // LocalStack S3 is already running with test-bucket created
 *     // Test your file storage logic here
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p><b>Prerequisites:</b>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Docker must be installed and running on the test machine
 *   <li>Testcontainers dependency must be included in the project
 *   <li>LocalStack Testcontainers module must be included
 *   <li>Sufficient Docker resources to run LocalStack container
 * </ul>
 *
 * @see FacadeIT
 * @see org.testcontainers.containers.localstack.LocalStackContainer
